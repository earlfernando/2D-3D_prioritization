## Abstract
Estimating the position and orientation from which an image was taken with respect
to some scene representation is one of the main topics of research in the field of
computer science. Recent advancements in Structure from motion has helped us to
reconstruct large scale 3D models which could be used for the camera pose estimation
of an image,by matching its 2D points with the 3D points in the model. But the
matching these points would be time consuming.This thesis proposes to a novel
method to prioritize the 2D points from the image in a effective manner for 3D
matching and this prioritization function is evaluated with extensive experiments
